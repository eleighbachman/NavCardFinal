This is an example of an interactive card for Nav.

By including a JSON file of UI data, and specifying one of two classes "information" or "addContent" you can create reusable and dynamic card types that either reflect information to a user based on financial qualifications, or create forms to submit account data to the backend. Additional classes of card styles could easily be created by extending the JSON UI formatting, and creating a new component type in the vein of "InfoCard" and "AddCard."

This card could be further extended with an understanding of where data would flow from, how data could be saved per user, and other features of a user portal that would be necessary to meet Nav's business and customer service goals.

Run "npm run test" to launch the testing suite of reducers and actions, otherwise "npm start" to launch the app.
